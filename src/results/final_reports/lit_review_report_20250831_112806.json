            "abstract": "This work considers decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the global states and rewards are assumed to be fully observable, while the local behavior policy is preserved locally for resisting adversarial attack. In order to cooperatively accumulate more rewards, the agents exchange messages among a time-varying communication network to reach consensus. For these cooperative tasks, we propose a decentralized actor-critic algorithm, where the agents make individual decisions, but the joint behavior policy is optimized towards more cumulative rewards. We provide the theoretical analysis towards the convergence under the tabular setting and then expand it to nonlinear function approximations. Furthermore, by incorporating decentralized distribution correction, the agents are trained in an off-policy manner for higher sample efficiency. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the algorithms, where the proposed algorithm performs competitively in both stability and asymptotic performance. Note to Practitioners\u2014Fully decentralized MARL algorithms are widely applied in multi-agent systems for generating cooperative behaviors, e.g., multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) cooperatively performing search and rescue tasks, multiple vehicles efficiently passing a crowded intersection, and multiple robots cooperatively handling cargo or obstacles. Focusing on these potential applications, this work is motivated to improve the sample efficiency of recent decentralized MARL algorithms by incorporating off-policy training approaches. In this work, we reweight historical trajectories via a decentralized average consensus step and develop corresponding policy-optimization procedures, with which previous trajectories could be used to stabilize later iterations. Since the training materials are augmented by historical samples, the sample efficiency is significantly improved, and the training process is stabilized. With the fully decentralized training approach, the proposed algorithms are expected to be applied in large-scale systems, e.g., vehicle teams and UAV groups, for effective real-time control.",

The present paper explores the design and application of CSBCS, emphasizing its ability to foster adaptability, robustness, and scalability in dynamic environments. The CSBCS framework integrates cognitive models that simulate human-like thinking, enabling individual agents within the swarm to operate autonomously, collaborate effectively, and adapt to changing conditions without centralized oversight. The experimental findings, derived from simulations and real-world applications demonstrate the potential of CSBCS in augmenting both individual and collective performance across a spectrum of domains, ranging from multi-robot coordination to critical infrastructure protection.

MAGPO uses an auto-regressive joint policy for scalable, coordinated exploration and explicitly aligns it with decentralized policies to ensure deployability under partial observability. We provide theoretical guarantees of monotonic policy improvement and empirically evaluate MAGPO on 43 tasks across 6 diverse environments. Results show that MAGPO consistently outperforms strong CTDE baselines and matches or surpasses fully centralized approaches, offering a principled and practical solution for decentralized multi-agent learning.

            "abstract": "Determining multi-robot motion policies for persistently monitoring a region with limited sensing, communication, and localization constraints in non-GPS environments is a challenging problem. To take the localization constraints into account, in this paper, we consider a heterogeneous robotic system consisting of two types of agents: anchor agents with accurate localization capability and auxiliary agents with low localization accuracy. To localize itself, the auxiliary agents must be within the communication range of an {anchor}, directly or indirectly. The robotic team's objective is to minimize environmental uncertainty through persistent monitoring. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MARL) based architecture with graph convolution called Graph Localized Proximal Policy Optimization (GALOPP), which incorporates the limited sensor field-of-view, communication, and localization constraints of the agents along with persistent monitoring objectives to determine motion policies for each agent. We evaluate the performance of GALOPP on open maps with obstacles having a different number of anchor and auxiliary agents. We further study (i) the effect of communication range, obstacle density, and sensing range on the performance and (ii) compare the performance of GALOPP with non-RL baselines, namely, greedy search, random search, and random search with communication constraint. For its generalization capability, we also evaluated GALOPP in two different environments -- 2-room and 4-room. The results show that GALOPP learns the policies and monitors the area well. As a proof-of-concept, we perform hardware experiments to demonstrate the performance of GALOPP.",

In this work, we identify a subtler failure mode that arises \\textit{even when the expected policy gradients of all agents point toward an optimal solution.} After collecting a finite set of trajectories, stochasticity in independent action sampling can cause the joint data distribution to deviate from the expected joint on-policy distribution. This \\textit{sampling error} w.r.t. the joint on-policy distribution produces inaccurate gradient estimates that can lead agents to converge suboptimally. In this paper, we investigate if joint sampling error can be reduced through coordinated action selection and whether doing so improves the reliability of policy gradient learning in MARL. Toward this end, we introduce an adaptive action sampling approach to reduce joint sampling error. Our method, Multi-Agent Proximal Robust On-Policy Sampling (MA-PROPS), uses a centralized behavior policy that we continually adapt to place larger probability on joint actions that are currently under-sampled w.r.t. the current joint policy. We empirically evaluate MA-PROPS in a diverse range of multi-agent games and demonstrate that (1) MA-PROPS reduces joint sampling error more efficiently than standard on-policy sampling and (2) improves the reliability of independent policy gradient algorithms, increasing the fraction of training runs that converge to an optimal joint policy.",

However, decentralized policies operate under partial observability and often yield suboptimal performance compared to centralized policies, while fully centralized approaches typically face scalability challenges as the number of agents increases. We propose Centralized Permutation Equivariant (CPE) learning, a centralized training and execution framework that employs a fully centralized policy to overcome these limitations. Our approach leverages a novel permutation equivariant architecture, Global-Local Permutation Equivariant (GLPE) networks, that is lightweight, scalable, and easy to implement. Experiments show that CPE integrates seamlessly with both value decomposition and actor-critic methods, substantially improving the performance of standard CTDE algorithms across cooperative benchmarks including MPE, SMAC, and RWARE, and matching the performance of state-of-the-art RWARE implementations.",

Heterogeneous-Agent Trust Region Policy Optimization (HATRPO) enforces per-agent trust region constraints using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to stabilize training. However, assigning each agent the same KL threshold can lead to slow and locally optimal updates, especially in heterogeneous settings. To address this limitation, we propose two approaches for allocating the KL divergence threshold across agents: HATRPO-W, a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-based (KKT-based) method that optimizes threshold assignment under global KL constraints, and HATRPO-G, a greedy algorithm that prioritizes agents based on improvement-to-divergence ratio. By connecting sequential policy optimization with constrained threshold scheduling, our approach enables more flexible and effective learning in heterogeneous-agent settings. Experimental results demonstrate that our methods significantly boost the performance of HATRPO, achieving faster convergence and higher final rewards across diverse MARL benchmarks. Specifically, HATRPO-W and HATRPO-G achieve comparable improvements in final performance, each exceeding 22.5%. Notably, HATRPO-W also demonstrates more stable learning dynamics, as reflected by its lower variance.",

Explorers employ frontier detection to explore the unknown areas enhanced with RSSI-aware frontier choosing mechanism, while supporters autonomously position themselves using Flocking inspired behavior, forming communication relays. A comparative evaluation of machine learning models trained on FIT-IoT-Lab-collected signal propagation data enables the system to predict RSSI values in different environments. The system's innovation lies in its integration of flocking-based swarm coordination with data-driven connectivity prediction, addressing the challenge of maintaining network stability while exploring unknown areas efficiently. In addition, the system is designed to operate within the strict computational constraints typical of embedded robotic platforms, leveraging lightweight machine learning models that enable real-time connectivity predictions.",

These challenges can be addressed by introducing mechanisms that facilitate coordination and high-level planning. Specifically, coordination and temporal abstraction can be achieved through communication (e.g., message passing) and Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approaches to decision-making. However, optimization issues limit the applicability of hierarchical policies to multi-agent systems. As such, the combination of these approaches has not been fully explored. To fill this void, we propose a novel and effective methodology for learning multi-agent hierarchies of message-passing policies. We adopt the feudal HRL framework and rely on a hierarchical graph structure for planning and coordination among agents. Agents at lower levels in the hierarchy receive goals from the upper levels and exchange messages with neighboring agents at the same level. To learn hierarchical multi-agent policies, we design a novel reward-assignment method based on training the lower-level policies to maximize the advantage function associated with the upper levels. Results on relevant benchmarks show that our method performs favorably compared to the state of the art.",

However, how to manage such complex systems to ensure real-time adaptability lacks sufficient research. Hence, in this article, we propose the cooperative cognitive dynamic system (CCDS) to optimize the management of UAV swarms. CCDS leverages a hierarchical and cooperative control structure that enables real-time data processing and decision. Accordingly, CCDS optimizes UAV swarm management via dynamic reconfigurability and adaptive intelligent optimization. In addition, CCDS can be integrated with a biomimetic mechanism to efficiently allocate tasks for UAV swarms. Further, the distributed coordination of CCDS ensures reliable and resilient control, thus enhancing adaptability and robustness. Finally, the potential challenges and future directions are analyzed to provide insights into managing UAV swarms in dynamic heterogeneous networking.",

The methodology unfolds in four key aspects: firstly, by harnessing swarm intelligence principles, the approach enhances coordination among multiple robots in agricultural settings, fostering collaboration and dynamic task allocation in response to real-time changes. Secondly, the integration of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) introduces a powerful optimization technique, enabling the algorithm to dynamically adapt the swarm's configuration. This adaptability optimizes task allocation and individual robot positions, enhancing overall efficiency. Thirdly, the methodology systematically tackles scalability, adaptability, and robustness challenges in agricultural automation. By synergizing swarm intelligence and PSO, it ensures efficient scalability with an increasing number of robots and responsiveness to evolving agricultural demands. The holistic design makes it well-suited for practical implementation in real-world agricultural scenarios. A series of experiments varying PSO parameters were conducted, revealing nuanced relationships between iterations, swarm size, and coefficients and their impact on convergence time and fitness metrics. The outcomes demonstrate the trade-offs involved in selecting these parameters for efficient coordination in agricultural tasks. A comparative analysis with ABO and ACO highlights PSO's superior performance, achieving remarkable fitness value of 98% in the context of robotic swarm applications.",

Saving energy and maintaining comfort still challenge scientists as they conflict. The control of HVAC systems can be improved by modeling their behavior, which is nonlinear, complex, and dynamic and works in uncertain contexts. Scientific literature shows that Soft Computing techniques require fewer computing resources but at the expense of some controlled accuracy loss. Metaheuristics-search-based algorithms show positive results, although further research will be necessary to resolve new challenging multi-objective optimization problems. This article compares the performance of selected genetic and swarm-intelligence-based algorithms with the aim of discerning their capabilities in the field of smart buildings. MOGA, NSGA-II/III, OMOPSO, SMPSO, and Random Search, as benchmarking, are compared in hypervolume, generational distance, \u03b5-indicator, and execution time. Real data from the Building Management System of Teatro Real de Madrid have been used to train a data model used for the multiple objective calculations. The novelty brought by the analysis of the different proposed dynamic optimization algorithms in the transient time of an HVAC system also includes the addition, to the conventional optimization objectives of comfort and energy efficiency, of the coefficient of performance, and of the rate of change in ambient temperature, aiming to extend the equipment lifecycle and minimize the overshooting effect when passing to the steady state. The optimization works impressively well in energy savings, although the results must be balanced with other real considerations, such as realistic constraints on chillers\u2019 operational capacity. The intuitive visualization of the performance of the two families of algorithms in a real multi-HVAC system increases the novelty of this proposal.",

In swarm robotics, the exclusive use of decentralized control relying on local communication and information provides the key advantage first of scalability, and second of robustness against failure points. These are directly useful in certain applied tasks that can be studied in laboratory environments, such as self-assembly and self-organized construction. In this article, we give a brief introduction to swarm robotics for a broad audience, with the intention of targeting future industrial applications. We then present a summary of four examples of our recently published research results with simple models. First, we present our approach to self-reconfiguration, which uses collective adjustment of swarm density in a dynamic setting. Second, we describe our robot experiments for self-organized material deployment in structured and semi-structured environments, applicable to braided composites. Third, we present our machine learning approach for self-assembly, motivated as a simple model developing foundational methods, which generates self-organizing robot behaviors to form emergent patterns. Fourth, we describe our experiments implementing a bioinspired model in a robot swarm, where we show self-healing of damage as the robots collectively locate a resource. Overall, the four examples we present concern robustness, scalability, and self-X features, which we propose as potentially relevant to future research in swarm robotics applied to industry sectors. We summarize these approaches as an introduction to our recent research, targeting the broad audience of this journal.",

Agents exchange only output information with their neighbors over a directed communication graph, without requiring full state measurements or symmetric communication. Achieving fixed time consensus, where convergence occurs within a pre-specified time bound that is independent of initial conditions is faced with significant challenges due to the presence of unknown nonlinearities, inter-agent couplings, and external disturbances. This work addresses these challenges by integrating actor critic reinforcement learning with a novel fixed time adaptation mechanism. Each agent employs an actor critic architecture supported by two estimator networks designed to handle system uncertainties and unknown perturbations. The adaptation laws are developed to ensure that all agents track the leader within a fixed time regardless of their initial conditions. The consensus and tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, with the convergence radius adjustable through control parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.",

By integrating causal information through state abstraction, MultiSACReM enables agents to learn more effectively in complex, dynamic settings. In our framework, each agent employs a reward machine, to optimize its behavior. Multi-SACReM identifies and eliminates redundant causal relationships, allowing agents to focus on essential interactions and optimize policies accordingly. Our approach works in both decentralized settings, where agents learn independently using local observations, and centralized RL environments. In centralized RL, a controller coordinates agents using global information to optimize collective behavior. We evaluate Multi-SACReM through case studies comparing decentralized versus centralized approaches. Results show Multi-SACReM effectively learns causal models with reward machines, comparing decentralized versus centralized approaches in multi-agent settings.",

In this paper, an improved swarm optimization technique, named Grand Tour Algorithm (GTA), based on the behavior of a peloton of cyclists, which embodies relevant physical concepts, is introduced and applied to fourteen benchmarking optimization problems to evaluate its performance in comparison to four other popular classical optimization metaheuristic algorithms. These problems are tackled initially, for comparison purposes, with 1000 variables. Then, they are confronted with up to 20,000 variables, a really large number, inspired in the human genome. The obtained results show that GTA clearly outperforms the other algorithms. To strengthen GTA\u2019s value, various sensitivity analyses are performed to verify the minimal influence of the initial parameters on efficiency. It is demonstrated that the GTA fulfils the fundamental requirements of an optimization algorithm such as ease of implementation, speed of convergence, and reliability. Since optimization permeates modeling and simulation, we finally propose that GTA will be appealing for the agent-based community, and of great help for a wide variety of agent-based applications.",

The main objective is to provide better convergence as well finest results in the solutions of various real world applications. The particle swarm optimization is generally acted as a foundation in the area of swarm intelligence. The modified PSO used a improved weight factor to provide a better convergence than the conventional PSO. But many real world problems need a further refinement in the solution. Therefore, in this paper two types of well known mutations are used with the modified PSO for betterment in the refining process. The proposed mutations are Gaussian mutation and Cauchy mutation. The proposed mutated modified PSO algorithms are simulated by the use of standard benchmarking functions to establish their dominance over the already modified PSO. Between Cauchy MPSO and Gaussian MPSO, the overall performance of Cauchy MPSO is better. The use of Cauchy mutation as well as Gaussian mutation in the modified PSO helps in the improvement of the convergence of the modified PSO for approaching much better solutions.",

Intelligent transportation systems play a fundamental role in solving these challenges, through accurate traffic prediction. In this study, we propose a hybrid model that combines the Long-Term Memory Algorithm (LSTM) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to predict traffic flow more accurately at intersections. Our approach takes advantage of the strength of PSO, a robust optimization technique inspired by swarm intelligence, to optimize the hyperparameters of the LSTM algorithm. Through in-depth benchmarking, we evaluate the performance of our hybrid LSTM-PSO model against other existing models. By evaluating measures such as root mean square error and mean absolute error, we demonstrate the superior efficiency of the proposed hybrid model. Our results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in outperforming alternative models, offering a promising solution for intelligent transportation systems to accurately predict traffic flow at intersections and improve overall traffic management efficiency.",

This novel approach initially integrates the concept of sliding innovation to refine the measurement update phase of the LKF, ensuring that the filter\u2019s innovation is constrained within predetermined bounds; the resultant robust filter is designated as the Bounded Innovation Lattice Kalman Filter (BILF). To enhance its numerical stability and adaptive response to rapid changes in the process model or observational data, a Jacobian-free formulation of BILF with a time-varying bounded layer is first developed and then augmented with the adaptive fading factor strategy, leading to the establishment of a robust estimation method, termed as Strong Tracking LKF (ST-LKF). The developed estimation algorithm, in comparison with several renowned filters, is applied to the real-time estimation of states and output power of a single-machine infinite bus (SMIB) system under significantly noisy conditions. The effectiveness of ST-LKF is rigorously tested against a spectrum of operational conditions, including time-variant step and/or ramp inputs, measurement outliers, and short circuits, encompassing both stable and unstable states. Simulation results validate that the proposed filtering strategy excels in terms of accuracy and robustness when faced with model uncertainties and extreme noise levels, consistently maintaining its performance in estimating states across different designed scenarios.",

Despite growing interest, a comprehensive synthesis of their real-world applications, performance, and limitations is lacking. This systematic review aims to evaluate the deployment of MAS in healthcare across three key domains: Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS), Robotic Interventions, and Critical Care Monitoring. It also addresses ethical and legal considerations, offers a comparative framework, and identifies research gaps. A systematic search of PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. A total of 150 records were retrieved. After duplicate removal and screening, 32 studies met inclusion criteria. The Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist guided quality assessment. Data were extracted using a structured form and organized by topic. Among the 32 studies included, 12 focused on MAS-based CDSS, 11 on robotic interventions, and 9 on MAS in critical care. Most MAS demonstrated improved diagnostic accuracy, aided real-time decision support, and enhanced patient monitoring. However, over 60% involved practical models and lacked clinical validation. Ethical concerns, particularly around autonomy, data privacy, transparency, and legal accountability were sometimes overlooked. Only 7 studies discussed ethical or legal implications in depth. A comparative framework was developed, comparing MAS tools based on scalability, clinical validation, autonomy, human-AI interaction, and data transparency. No doubt, MAS hold transformative potential across healthcare domains. However, real-world deployment remains unclear. Greater emphasis on clinical validation, ethical design, and regulatory frameworks is needed. This review provides suggestions for future research and responsible adoption of MAS in healthcare.",

To address these issues, this paper presents an improved whale optimization algorithm with multiple strategies, called Dynamic Gain-Sharing Whale Optimization Algorithm (DGSWOA). Specifically, a Sine\u2013Tent\u2013Cosine map is first adopted to more effectively initialize the population, ensuring a more uniform distribution of individuals across the search space. Then, a gaining\u2013sharing knowledge based algorithm is used to enhance global search capability and avoid falling into a local optimum. Finally, to increase the diversity of solutions, Dynamic Opposition-Based Learning is incorporated for population updating. The effectiveness of our approach is evaluated through comparative experiments on blackbox optimization benchmarking and two engineering application problems. The experimental results suggest that the proposed method is competitive in terms of solution quality and convergence speed in most cases.",

Within these structured communities, LLMs are designed to specialize in distinct cognitive tasks, employ advanced interaction mechanisms such as direct communication, voting systems, and market-based approaches, and dynamically adjust their governance structures to meet changing demands.

            "abstract": "Voltage regulation within automatic voltage regulator (AVR) systems presents a significant engineering challenge due to uncertain load conditions. Consequently, employing a PID-based controller is crucial for maintaining AVR system performance. Recently, there has been a growing interest in utilizing better optimization tools to tune the PID control parameters, providing an advantage in enhancing AVR system output response while maintaining the robustness and simplicity of PID controller. However, existing optimization tools for tuning PID controllers, particularly those based on multi-agent optimization, often involve many function evaluations, resulting in high computational burdens. This study introduces a novel approach using a new non-monopolize (NO) search algorithm to tune the PID controller in AVR systems. The NO search method, which is in the class of single agent-based optimization techniques, requires fewer number of function evaluations per iteration, addressing the computational burden issue. Simulation analyses, including convergence curve of the fitness function, time response specification analysis of step response, stability analysis using Bode plot, computational effort analysis based on number of function evaluations (NFE), are conducted to assess the efficacy of the proposed NO-based PID controller for AVR systems. The results indicate that the proposed NO-based PID controller is highly effective in producing better function of demerit (FOD) with less values of NFE in comparison with other existing well-known based methods.",

The proposed application, Web Information Retrieval System Architecture Based on SMS (WIRSABoSMS), normalizes SMS language to retain its original syntactic structure. The concept of mobile agents in web technology was introduced as a medium to achieving Short Message Service (SMS) normalization. SMS normalization was carried out with the adoption of multi-agent technology, as agents are involved in character search, sort, and compare of the strings written in SMS form into its parental orthography. This architecture was designed based on web information retrieval system (IRS) in order to achieve SMS normalization. BLEU (bilingual evaluation understudy) was used to evaluate the quality of text. BLEU scores compare the human judgment with that of the machine translation using two set of corpora. The outcome of syntactic text message normalization recorded an average of 90% performance (for the corpus collected from researchers) when compared with the similar test conducted with human judgment using BLEU scores metric in an health-related domain.",

Like other metaheuristic algorithms, AAA faces challenges such as local optima and premature convergence. Various strategies to address these issues and enhance the performance of the algorithm have been proposed in the literature. These include levy flight, local search, variable search, intelligent search, multi-agent systems, and quantum behaviors. This paper introduces chaos theory as a strategy to improve AAA's performance. Chaotic maps are utilized to effectively balance exploration and exploitation, prevent premature convergence, and avoid local minima. Ten popular chaotic maps are employed to enhance AAA's performance, resulting in the chaotic artificial algae algorithm (CAAA). CAAA's performance is evaluated on thirty benchmark test functions, including unimodal, multimodal, and fixed dimension problems. The algorithm is also tested on three classical engineering problems and eight space trajectory design problems at the European Space Agency. A statistical analysis using the Friedman and Wilcoxon tests confirms that CAA demonstrates successful performance in optimization problems.",

By employing a novel model structure adaptation algorithm, the DPD model structure can be adaptively adjusted during its real-time deployment to keep the optimum size and complexity under different operation conditions. Power consumption of DPD can be reduced by on-demand automatic model structure adaptation instead of reusing the same model structure for all power levels and band allocations. To realize dynamic model sizing, the adaptation algorithm explores new potential terms based on prior knowledge of the model structure and prunes the DPD model with a stepwise backward regression method. Experimental results show that the algorithm can quickly find the optimum model structure when the operation condition changes. During the adaptation, it can also maintain robust linearization performance with a relatively low computational complexity and thus demonstrates itself as a suitable solution to the linearization of future broadband wireless systems.",
