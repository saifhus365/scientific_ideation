Anomaly detection of time series data can predict the potential problems of the system in advance and play an important role in ensuring the reliability and providing decision-making basis of the system. However, in the existing methods, how to effectively capture the long-term and short-term dependencies and global data characteristics in time series data is still facing challenges. In order to overcome these problems, we propose a Self-attention-enhanced time convolutional network (SATCN). The SATCN adopts time convolution neural network architecture and introduces self-attention mechanism, which enables it to process long input sequences in parallel and dynamically study the key information in the input sequences, thus can improve its long-term and short-term dependence modeling ability. The experimental results show that SATCN is superior to traditional models including LSTM and CNN and other methods in anomaly detection task, and has the potential to solve the challenge of complex time series analysis.",

In this article, we proposed a Dilated Convolutional Transformer-based GAN (DCT-GAN) to enhance accuracy and improve generalization capability of the model. Specifically, DCT-GAN utilize several generators and a single discriminator to alleviate the mode collapse problem. Each generator consists of a dilated convolutional neural network and a Transformer block to obtain fine-grained and coarse-grained information of the time series, which is a useful component to improve generalization capability. We also use weight-based mechanism to balance these generators. Experiments verify the effectiveness of our method and each part of DCT-GAN.",

This paper proposes a novel unsupervised anomaly detection model using spatial-temporal self-attention based on transformer architecture, denoted the biself-attention anomaly detection (BSAAD) model. The BSAAD model not only utilizes a time-step encoder with a self-attention mechanism to capture temporal correlation but also constructs a sensor encoder with a self-attention mechanism to capture spatial correlation among multivariate time series data. To amplify the reconstruction errors of anomalous points during network training, a two-phase training style with an adversarial training strategy is used to improve the anomaly detection performance of the BSAAD model.

Accurate detection of anomalies is crucial in various application scenarios. This article focuses on unsupervised anomaly detection from multivariate time series (MTS), as real-world data collected from sources such as wearable devices, medical equipment, and industrial machines typically manifest as MTS and are often unlabeled. Anomaly detection in MTS represents a data-driven challenge that traditionally requires substantial centralized data for training models. However, in practice, data are frequently distributed among multiple institutions, with privacy concerns restricting unrestricted access. To address these issues, we introduce feature decoupling federated learning (FDFL), an approach designed to collaboratively train a representation learning network over multiple clients for unsupervised anomaly detection in MTS. Unlike previous methods that simply integrate MTS anomaly detection (MTS-AD) algorithms with federated learning (FL) strategies, FDFL specifically addresses heterogeneity among clients by decoupling the representation network into shared and private branches through a contrastive learning mechanism. This method aggregates shared parameters during each federated round while maintaining client-specific private parameters locally. Additionally, we develop a self-attention block that integrates the representations derived from both shared and private parameters to reconstruct MTS and identify anomalies based on reconstruction errors. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that FDFL outperforms existing algorithms in most cases, highlighting the effectiveness and superiority of our proposed method in MTS-AD.",

An unlabelled time series radiotherapy dataset with artificially inserted anomalies was used to evaluate the performance of these models, with a goal to identify anomalous data in medical radiation which could signify dangerous spikes or inadequate dosages for a patient. The results indicates that the LSTM autoencoder model showed the best performance in accurately detecting anomalies within in the medical radiation dataset, due to its ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies. Meanwhile, RCAE performed the best on a separate dataset from the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), suggesting its strength in handling datasets with structured or spatial patterns. The study highlights the importance of considering temporal relationships for anomaly detection in sequential data and provides insights into the strengths of different models for specific applications.",

This paper proposes TSI-GAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection model for time-series that can learn complex temporal patterns automatically and generalize well, i.e., no need for choosing dataset-specific parameters, making statistical assumptions about underlying data, or changing model architectures. To achieve these goals, we convert each input time-series into a sequence of 2D images using two encoding techniques with the intent of capturing temporal patterns and various types of deviance. Moreover, we design a reconstructive GAN that uses convolutional layers in an encoder-decoder network and employs cycle-consistency loss during training to ensure that inverse mappings are accurate as well. In addition, we also instrument a Hodrick-Prescott filter in post-processing to mitigate false positives. We evaluate TSI-GAN using 250 well-curated and harder-than-usual datasets and compare with 8 state-of-the-art baseline methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of TSI-GAN to all the baselines, offering an overall performance improvement of 13% and 31% over the second-best performer MERLIN and the third-best performer LSTM-AE, respectively.",

However, detecting anomalies in time series data is particularly challenging due to the vague definition o f a nomalies and said data\u2019s frequent lack of labels and highly complex temporal correlations. Current state-of-the-art unsupervised machine learning methods for anomaly detection suffer from scalability and portability issues, and may have high false positive rates. In this paper, we propose TadGAN, an unsupervised anomaly detection approach built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). To capture the temporal correlations of time series distributions, we use LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks as base models for Generators and Critics. TadGAN is trained with cycle consistency loss to allow for effective time-series data reconstruction. We further propose several novel methods to compute reconstruction errors, as well as different approaches to combine reconstruction errors and Critic outputs to compute anomaly scores. To demonstrate the performance and generalizability of our approach, we test several anomaly scoring techniques and report the best-suited one. We compare our approach to 8 baseline anomaly detection methods on 11 datasets from multiple reputable sources such as NASA, Yahoo, Numenta, Amazon, and Twitter. The results show that our approach can effectively detect anomalies and outperform baseline methods in most cases (6 out of 11). Notably, our method has the highest averaged F1 score across all the datasets. Our code is open source and is available as a benchmarking tool.",

However, due to the inherent characteristics of time series, such as tremendous data volumes, the imbalance of normal data and abnormal data, additional constraints and challenges are added for anomaly detection for time series. We present a novel anomaly detection framework, which applies temporal convolutional networks to extract features of time series and combined Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference to detect anomalies of systems. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, experiments are carried out on two typical time series datasets including EEG dataset and current dataset of electrical equipment. The experiments indicate that temporal convolutional network can contribute to extracting salient features of time series and Gaussian mixture model with Bayesian inference has good generalization and reliability for anomaly detection. Meanwhile, the designed architecture and analysis approach of anomaly detection reveal the method\u2019s effectiveness and generalization in the feature extraction and anomaly detection for other time series.",

However, there is always a risk of patients being subject to the wrong diagnosis or to a certain treatment not pertaining to the desired effect, potentially leading to adverse events. Thus, there is a need to develop an anomaly detection system for deviations from expected clinical progress. As a first step towards this goal we have considered methods for categorization of typical developments, coined phenotype trajectories. We analyzed 16 months of vital sign recordings obtained from the Nordland Hospital Trust (NHT), where we employed an self-supervised framework based on the STraTS transformer architecture to represent the time series data in a latent space. These representations were then subjected to various clustering techniques to explore potential phenotype trajectories. While our preliminary results from this ongoing research are promising, they underscore the importance of enhancing the dataset with additional demographic information from patients. This additional data will be crucial for a more comprehensive evaluation of the method\u2019s performance.

Conventional anomaly detection approaches like signal processing and statistical modelling often struggle to effectively handle the intricacies of complex systems, particularly when dealing with multi-variate signals. In contrast, neural network-based anomaly detection methods, especially Auto-Encoders, have emerged as a compelling alternative, demonstrating remarkable performance. However, Auto-Encoders exhibit inherent opaqueness in their decision-making processes, hindering their practical implementation at scale. Addressing this opacity is essential for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of anomaly detection models. In this work, we address this challenge by employing a feature selector to select features and counterfactual explanations to give a context to the model output. We tested this approach on the SKAB benchmark dataset and an industrial time-series dataset. The gradient based counterfactual explanation approach was evaluated via validity, sparsity and distance measures. Our experimental findings illustrate that our proposed counterfactual approach can offer meaningful and valuable insights into the model decision-making process, by explaining fewer signals compared to conventional approaches. These insights enhance the trustworthiness and interpretability of anomaly detection models.",

Learning similarities among different time series is a crucial problem since it serves as the foundation for downstream analysis such as clustering and anomaly detection. It often remains unclear what kind of distance metric is suitable for similarity learning due to the complex temporal dynamics of the time series generated from event-triggered sensing, which is common in diverse applications, including automated driving, interactive healthcare, and smart home automation. The overarching goal of this paper is to develop an unsupervised learning framework that is capable of learning task-aware similarities among unlabeled event-triggered time series. From the machine learning vantage point, the proposed framework harnesses the power of both hierarchical multi-scale sequence autoencoders and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to effectively learn the low-dimensional representations from the time series. Finally, the obtained similarity measure can be easily visualized for explaining. The proposed framework aspires to offer a stepping stone that gives rise to a systematic approach to model and learn similarities among a multitude of event-triggered time series. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments, it is revealed that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods considerably.",

Current grading systems based on imaging biomarkers only coarsely group disease stages into broad categories and are unable to predict future disease progression. It is widely believed that this is due to their focus on a single point in time, disregarding the dynamic nature of the disease. In this work, we present the first method to automatically discover biomarkers that capture temporal dynamics of disease progression. Our method represents patient time series as trajectories in a latent feature space built with contrastive learning. Then, individual trajectories are partitioned into atomic sub-sequences that encode transitions between disease states. These are clustered using a newly introduced distance metric. In quantitative experiments we found our method yields temporal biomarkers that are predictive of conversion to late AMD. Furthermore, these clusters were highly interpretable to ophthalmologists who confirmed that many of the clusters represent dynamics that have previously been linked to the progression of AMD, even though they are currently not included in any clinical grading system.",

However, existing approaches typically focus on task-specific model customization, such as forecasting and anomaly detection, while overlooking the data itself, referred to as time-series primitives, which are essential for in-depth reasoning. This position paper advocates a fundamental shift in approaching time-series reasoning with LLMs: prioritizing alignment paradigms grounded in the intrinsic primitives of time series data over task-specific model customization. This realignment addresses the core limitations of current time-series reasoning approaches, which are often costly, inflexible, and inefficient, by systematically accounting for intrinsic structure of data before task engineering. To this end, we propose three alignment paradigms: Injective Alignment, Bridging Alignment, and Internal Alignment, which are emphasized by prioritizing different aspects of time-series primitives: domain, characteristic, and representation, respectively, to activate time-series reasoning capabilities of LLMs to enable economical, flexible, and efficient reasoning. We further recommend that practitioners adopt an alignment-oriented method to avail this instruction to select an appropriate alignment paradigm. Additionally, we categorize relevant literature into these alignment paradigms and outline promising research directions.",

The change detection method is based on a 2D-first-order autoregressive ([2D-AR(1)]) recursion that predicts one-lag changes over bitemporal signals, followed by a high-parallelized spatial filtering for neighborhood training, and an estimated quantile function to detect anomalies. The proposed method uses a model-based on the functional language paradigm and a well-defined MoC, potentially enabling energy and runtime optimizations with deterministic data parallelism over multicore, GPU, or FPGA architectures. Experimental results over the bitemporal CARABAS-II SAR UWB dataset are evaluated using the synchronous MoC implementation, achieving gains in detection and hardware performance compared to a closed-form and well-known complexity model over the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). In addition, since the one-lag AR(1) is a Markov process, its extension for a Markov chain in multitemporal (n-lags) analysis is applicable, potentially improving the detection performance still subject to high-parallelized structures.",

However, most deep-learning techniques have struggled to surpass or even match this level of success as traditional machine-learning methods. The primary reason is that these applications involve multi-source, heterogeneous data where features lack explicit relationships. This contrasts with image data, where pixels exhibit spatial relationships; textual data, where words have sequential dependencies; and graph data, where nodes are connected through established associations. The absence of explicit Feature Relation Patterns (FRPs) presents a significant challenge for deep learning techniques in scientific applications that are not image, text, and graph-based. In this paper, we introduce EAPCR, a universal feature extractor designed for data without explicit FRPs. Tested across various scientific tasks, EAPCR consistently outperforms traditional methods and bridges the gap where deep learning models fall short. To further demonstrate its robustness, we synthesize a dataset without explicit FRPs. While Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) and feature extractors like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), and Transformers struggle, EAPCR excels, demonstrating its robustness and superior performance in scientific tasks without FRPs.",

Existing SR Anomaly Detection (SR-AD) studies still suffer from several challenges under actual industrial scenarios: lengthy and diverse real-recordings, costly manual labelling, and subtle distinction in road track noises. For the first time, we proposed SRAD-CLF, a novel framework that leverages contrastive learning on Real Industrial Noise Recordings (RINR) to tackle these challenges. Specifically, we initiate the process by segmenting a complete audio sample into distinct road-surface-type audio clips, subsequently assigning a surface label to each clip. Then, a contrastive learning-based framework employing encoder perturbations is implemented to enhance representation, effectively mitigating risks associated with data augmentation, like context loss and the incorporation of irrelevant augmentation details into the features. To enhance the efficacy of SRAD-CLF, we integrate a classifier based on road surface-type information within a self-supervised learning framework, fortifying the performance of the SR-AD task. Our proposed SRAD-CLF achieves promising results for SR-AD on real-world industrial datasets collected from the Ford Manutacturing Plant in Valencia (Spain).",

            "abstract": "\n \n \n Nephron number highly varies between different species and within species, ranging in humans from 200 000 to 2 000 000 nephrons per kidney. Low nephron numbers can promote early onset of end-stage kidney disease. Nephron assessment is highly needed for better diagnosis and more targeted treatment. However, its assessment in vivo is not established in clinical practice yet. Pioneer studies suggest nephron number estimation in vivo through a combination of glomerular densities in kidney biopsies together with medical imaging. In contrast, post-mortem nephron assessment either using optical clearing or by exhaustive kidney sectioning is well studied but remains laborious. Here, we propose a new semi-automated nephron counting approach using serial PAS-stained whole slide kidney sections, deep learning segmentation and slide registration.\n \n \n \n Mice were sacrificed, kidneys harvested, measured, halved in the coronary plane and then opposingly embedded in paraffin. Subsequently, the entire kidney was sectioned with 10 \u00b5m thickness per slide. Tissue was stained with PAS and slides were digitalized using Aperio GT 450 DX scanner (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) (Fig.\u00a0a). Deep learning segmentation of glomeruli was performed in the first and every 10th (reference) section and subsequent (look-up) section using Tensorflow. Obtained segmentation results were manually quality controlled and adjusted, if necessary, in QuPath (Fig.\u00a0b). Final segmentations of the look-up slides were registered to the reference slides in ImageJ using manual landmarks with the ImageJ BigWarp plugin (Fig.\u00a0c). Glomeruli being present either in the look-up slide, or in the reference slide were counted as disector particles (Q-). Kidney areas on every examined slide were measured. Total number of glomeruli and total kidney area were determined as previously described (Fig.\u00a0d).\n \n \n \n A kidney from a 12-week-old mouse suffering chronic kidney disease (mouse line Alb-creERT2 (ki/ki); Glut9 (fl/fl)) was used. Kidney weight was 162 mg, length 11 mm, width 6 mm, depth 4 mm and kidney volume 260 mm\u00b3. In total the kidney was sectioned in 95 slices. 20 reference sections and its respective look-up sections were stained and digitalized. In total 5981 glomeruli were segmented in 40 kidney slices using the deep learning algorithm. Glomerular segmentation quality was verified by two independent observers (mean dice score 0.79). Inaccuracies, if any, where manually corrected. For image registration in average 18.1 landmarks per slide were created within the ImageJ BigWarp plugin. Registration took in average 5 minutes per slide. Glomeruli without match (disector particles, Q-) were automatically counted. Number of disector particles (Q-) ranged from 32 to 244 per slide. Total nephron number was 11.085 and kidney area 210 mm\u00b3. The differences to the manual measured volume (260 mm\u00b3) might be explained by discard of small kidney fractions for the used sectioning technique.\n \n \n \n We report, to our knowledge, the first deep learning assisted disector/fractionator approach to determine nephron number in whole slide kidney specimens. This method requires no physical disector setup, is scalable, cheap, time efficient, and unbiased. The method was so far validated in a mouse model of chronic kidney disease. The method will further be validated on different animal models. Additionally, occurrence of atubular glomeruli will be considered in nephron number determination. Furthermore, the integration of GFR measurements might allow the calculation of mean single nephron GFR and might together with automated glomerular area measurements unravel pathophysiologic processes in kidney ageing and disease.\n",

This study introduces Multi-Session Temporal Registration (MUSTER), a novel method that facilitates longitudinal analysis of changes in extended series of medical images. MUSTER improves upon conventional pairwise registration by incorporating more than two imaging sessions to recover longitudinal deformations. Longitudinal analysis at a voxel-level is challenging due to effects of a changing image contrast as well as instrumental and environmental sources of bias between sessions. We show that local normalized cross-correlation as an image similarity metric leads to biased results and propose a robust alternative. We test the performance of MUSTER on a synthetic multi-site, multi-session neuroimaging dataset and show that, in various scenarios, using MUSTER significantly enhances the estimated deformations relative to pairwise registration. Additionally, we apply MUSTER on a sample of older adults from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study. The results show that MUSTER can effectively identify patterns of neuro-degeneration from T1-weighted images and that these changes correlate with changes in cognition, matching the performance of state of the art segmentation methods. By leveraging GPU acceleration, MUSTER efficiently handles large datasets, making it feasible also in situations with limited computational resources.",

The aim of the study was to increase vital sign registration in paediatric patients through specific educational initiatives. Methods Prospective quasi-experimental study with interrupted time-series design in the North Denmark and South Denmark regions. The study consecutively included all children aged\u2009<\u200918\u00a0years attended by the emergency medical service (EMS) from 1 July 2019 to 31 December 2021. Specific educational initiatives were conducted only in the North Denmark EMS and included video learning and classroom training based on the European Paediatric Advanced Life Support principles. The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who had their respiratory rate, peripheral capillary oxygen saturation, heart rate and level of consciousness recorded at least twice. We used a binomial regression model stratified by age groups to compare proportions of the primary outcome in the pre- and post-intervention periods in each region. Results In North Denmark, 7551 patients were included, while 15,585 patients from South Denmark were used as a reference. Virtually all of the North Denmark EMS providers completed the video learning (98.7%). The total study population involved patients aged\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00a0months (5.5%), 3\u201311\u00a0months (7.4%), 1\u20132\u00a0years (18.8%), 3\u20137\u00a0years (16.2%) and\u2009\u2265\u20098\u00a0years (52.1%). In the intervention region, the primary outcome increased from the pre- to the post-intervention period from 35.3% to 40.5% [95% CI for difference 3.0;7.4]. There were large variations in between age groups with increases from 18.8% to 27.4% [95% CI for difference 5.3;12.0] among patients aged\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00a0years, from 33.5% to 43.7% [95% CI for difference 4.9;15.5] among patients aged 3\u20137\u00a0years and an insignificant increase among patients aged\u2009\u2265\u20098\u00a0years (from 46.4% to 47.9% [95% CI for difference\u2009\u2212\u20091.7;4.7]). In the region without the specific educational interventions, proportions were steady for all age groups throughout the entire study period. Conclusions Mandatory educational initiatives for EMS providers were associated with an increase in the extent of vital sign registration in paediatric patients\u2009\u2264\u20097\u00a0years. Incomplete vital registration was associated with, but not limited to non-urgent cases.",
