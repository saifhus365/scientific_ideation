            "abstract": "Barbie was the largest worldwide film release of 2023, dominating the box office with over $1 billion in earnings (PRNewswire). The reported marketing budget was over $150 million, which was greater than the $145 million spent on making the film (Adekaiyero). While marketing and public relations (PR) differ in approach and goals, the overall goal for Barbie was evident in the campaign: get fans excited for the film release. The number of collaborations, events, and advertisements executed for the Barbie campaign was extensive, with the convergence of traditional and digital media interplaying seamlessly. The vast majority of PR and marketing professionals were talking about the campaign as a superior example for the field to follow for the purposes of fuelling a passionate target audience. This article examines the public relations strategies that heightened fan interest in Barbie and reaffirms Barbie as a cultural icon. By analysing the most noteworthy components of the Barbie campaign that were highlighted in articles and PR blog posts, valuable insights are shared regarding how audience participation cultivates the success of cultural phenomena. These insights underscore the symbiotic relationship between PR practitioners and fans.\nPR\u2019s Role in Barbie\nThe film industry recognises the pivotal role PR plays in getting people to the theatre, especially in a post-COVID-19 world where it is estimated that only eight percent of US citizens go often to the theatres as of 2022, with over half never going to the movie theatres (Statista Research). Another factor that has affected movie-going trends is the accessibility of streaming services. A poll from HarrisX found that two-thirds of US adults prefer to wait for movies that premiere in theatres to be released on streaming (Maglio).\nIt\u2019s also becoming clear that the \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 opening weekend is a box office standout, as 2024 box office numbers are predicted to drop by over one billion dollars (D\u2019Alessandro). This was determined by the movies that have come out as of March 24, with anticipated titles like Madame Web and Argyle tanking, and Dune: Part Two being the best thus far with an $80 million at the box office (Carras). That is less than half of what Barbie made on opening weekend at $162 million (Fischer). Evidently, the hype around \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 is a topic that continues to be investigated, as reports of fan anecdotes and fan made content continue coming out (D\u2019Alessandro).\nBefore \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 became the plan for fans, the PR for Barbie started before production began. Presumably, those outside of PR and marketing professions assume that trailers are the starting point for promoting a film, but it starts at the beginning of the film\u2019s creation, when rumours and press releases come out revealing who is going to work on the project (Qiang). At the 2021 CinemaCon, Warner Bros made the announcement that a live-action Barbie movie would come to theatres in the summer of 2023 (Soares). The film\u2019s director and main star, Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie, were signed onto the project in 2020, and the full cast list was shared in 2022, which built excitement with fans because of the names attached to the project indicating the star power interest (Murphy).\nPre-production is key in starting to build excitement for any movie, but how Barbie approached pre-release with its trailers continued to build the mystery surrounding the movie\u2019s plot. The first teaser trailer was released as part of the series of trailers ahead of Avatar: The Way of Water (2022) \u2013 a highly anticipated sequel since Avatar broke all-time box office records in 2009 (Soares; Romano). Then, on 4 April 2023, character posters were released alongside the second trailer, which still didn\u2019t reveal much about the plot, but did incorporate snippets of dialogue that were indicative of a more PG-13 sense of humour (Soares). The character posters quickly became the Internet\u2019s new favourite meme because of the taglines that gave some insight into the Barbies and Kens in the movie (Hudgins). Joining in on the trend didn\u2019t require Photoshop; Warner Bros. partnered with PhotoRoom to create the interactive barbieselfie.ai generator, which was used over 13 million times since it was released on April 3 \u2013 a day ahead of the character posters (Barr).\nIn PR and marketing campaigns, earned media success is the goal, meaning that the social media buzz happens organically. Movie trailer spots and particular partnerships, as sometimes partners will pay to collaborate more on one side of the deal, are examples of paid media, which is most of what the marketing budget supports. In an interview with Variety, Josh Goldstine, Warner Bros. president of global marketing, used the terms \u2018earned media\u2019 and \u2018paid media\u2019 to talk about the different elements of the Barbie campaign (Rubin). These terms are rooted in the public relations lexicon of the PESO (paid media, earned media, shared media, and owned media) model, and evolve as multimedia channel opportunities expand (Detrich). Understanding where media types fit in the PESO Model ensures that a PR campaign has a holistic approach in reaching its target audience, or rather, \u2018publics\u2019, as a way of identifying consumers as co-creators (Pieczka).\nFor context, the PESO Model was coined by Gini Detrich in 2014, and it became popularised because it is a comprehensible, yet high-level framework categorising converged media (Brandpoint). Applying this model helps better understand the strategy and goals of PR, marketing, and advertising campaigns, and in the case of Barbie, figuring out where certain campaign comments fit in the model allows outsiders a means to ascertain the audience mapping. The terms \u2018audience\u2019 and \u2018publics\u2019 are often treated as synonymous in describing a group of consumers, but in the PR field, the key difference is that the former is passive in receiving PR messages, while the latter describes having an active response (Knighton and Wakefield). Having \u201can active response\u201d means being invited or motivated to take action as part of two-way communication (Knighton and Wakefield), and fans can use social media to voice their excitement and participate in unplanned trends, with \u2018Barbenheimer\u2019 being a prime example.\nAppealing to fans as the intended public of the Barbie campaign was crucial. The selfie AI generator was only the beginning in a series of earned media efforts. Barbie had over one hundred brand deals licenced before the movie was released in late July, with the licencing for products ranging from clothing brands to entertainment and lifestyle (Addley). All of the pink collaborations reignited Barbiecore as a fashion trend (Dockerman). Mattel having multiple partnerships enabled the notice around Barbie to have a life of its own as fans (Rubin). Essentially, the role of PR in Barbie aligns with what Barbie represents, which is to give the public a combination of empirical and imaginative thought to take action (Pieczka), or in other words, \u2018you can be anything\u2019 with Barbie.\n\nFig. 1: PESO model of Barbie campaign milestones.\nFan Engagement: All Things Barbiecore\nFan engagement is becoming an increasing focus of contemporary PR campaigns. The idea of what a \u201cfan\u201d is can vary but we have an inherent idea or assumption of what it means based on our standpoint, and academic definitions tend to revolve around being an \u201centhusiast\u201d or \u201ccultist\u201d and \u201cfollower\u201d (Hills). The research on the intersection of public relations and fandom is growing, as the need to better understand fandom audiences is pertinent to ideas of what being a fan means as an identity.\nAcademic works that specify the relationship between fandom and public relations are actualised in two editions co-edited by Hutchins and Tindall (2016; 2021). The current state of PR theories does not recognise fan motivations that occur within fandom, meaning that two-way communication has altered the responses that are gathered from target audiences (Hutchins and Tindall). In the case of Barbie, the earned media response is indicative of great success, such as having over 7 million social media mentions in 2023 and over 227 million engagement actions (Galliot). Conversation surrounding \u2018Barbiecore\u2019 outfit ideas alone saw over 11 million views on TikTok (Smith).\nFor movies, generating fan engagement is an obvious need. There are instances in the entertainment industry wherein movie fans or television fans mobilise out of passion to see certain ideas or wants fulfilled (Fraser and Buckler). The 2023 Writers Guild of America Strike taught the industry and the public many things about writing, wages, and AI, and how the strike relates to fan passions is that fans want to see quality, authentic writing, which AI cannot achieve (Lawler). The reveal of Greta Gerwig being part of Barbie as co-screenwriter and director made fans confused, yet excited, since Gerwig is well-known for feminist-centric movies (Dockterman). Fans love to support passionate creators who put thoughtful effort into the stories and characters, and with creating the first-ever live-action Barbie movie, the high feels to fill in were massive.\nBarbie has been around for sixty-five years and is one of the most recognisable toys on a global scale with 99 percent awareness (Weitzman). Though having over one hundred brand deals for promoting the movie can garner great fan appeal, having those deals does not promise success without consideration of what fans want. Barbie and Mattel have a long history, and the film \u201cdoesn\u2019t miss a beat\u201d \u2013 enabling the film to become enriched by acknowledging both Barbie\u2019s successes and polarising feminism (Lord). The movie premiere showed how Barbie was more than a doll, with a sea of pink outfits going to watch the movie, the fan response was more than the marketing team hoped for in setting its goals (Rubin).\nThough the exact sales numbers on how the different licences succeeded or not are unavailable, the social me",

            "abstract": "This study examines the impact of influencer marketing on consumer behavior through the lens of Social Influence Theory, focusing on campaigns conducted on TikTok, a platform renowned for its unique algorithm and highly engaged Gen Z audience. Employing a qualitative case study methodology, the research analyzes three successful TikTok campaigns: Chipotle\u2019s #GuacDance Challenge, Gymshark\u2019s fitness influencer initiative, and e.l.f. Cosmetics\u2019 #EyesLipsFace campaign. Findings reveal that influencers play pivotal roles as agents of both normative and informational influence. Normative influence fosters conformity and participation in viral trends, as demonstrated by Chipotle\u2019s campaign, which led to unprecedented digital sales. Informational influence builds trust in influencer expertise, evident in Gymshark\u2019s ability to enhance brand loyalty through fitness content. TikTok\u2019s features, such as user-generated content and virality potential, amplify these effects, making it a powerful tool for brand promotion. Thematic analysis highlights how influencer-driven strategies affect purchase decisions, brand loyalty, and user engagement. While these campaigns underscore TikTok\u2019s transformative role in digital marketing, the study acknowledges limitations, including its platform-specific focus and the use of a limited number of case studies. Future research could explore comparative analyses across different social media platforms to generalize findings. These insights offer theoretical contributions to understanding digital consumer behavior and practical recommendations for brands to optimize influencer collaborations on TikTok by selecting suitable influencers, crafting authentic content, and leveraging the platform\u2019s algorithm for maximum reach and engagement.",

Analysis of product or service marketing services before digital marketing developed was to use traditional methods such as print media, radio and television. Marketing using this old method involves promotions carried out without using the internet. As technology develops, now marketing products or services so that they are quickly recognized by the wider community does not require high costs for printing or paying for advertisements on TV. Marketing products or services can be done using digital media or what is usually called digital marketing. One of the popular digital platforms that quickly makes something or a product viral is the TikTok application. Tiktok is a social media that also has a tiktokshop feature to facilitate e-commerce. Tiktokshop offers advantages in terms of wide audience reach, high engagement, and innovative advertising features. However, a month ago, on October 4, 2023, Tiktokshop officially closed its services. This closure has an impact on business actors who have relied on this platform to market their products. However, there are still many other digital platforms that can be used for marketing activities. Therefore, business actors must continue to follow developments in digital marketing trends and utilize platforms and e-commerce that suit their target audience.",

            "abstract": "The tourism industry is unique in that workers are part of its product. In today's conditions, a properly planned marketing policy and quality work in social networks undoubtedly add competitive advantages to tourism organizations, positively affecting brand recognition and customer loyalty and, as a result, increasing sales. Every owner of a company in the field of tourism - a small travel agency, a network of agencies, or a large tour operator - is interested in making his company known to as many potential customers interested in the offered services as possible. Social networks are often used as an effective and inexpensive way of promotion to attract a paying audience. The use of ICT, SMM technologies, and modern digital channels increases the effectiveness of business communications in tourism. The availability of the Internet has changed the nature of advertising goods and services, led to changes in user activity, and influenced how advertising offers are distributed. Among the modern information and communication Internet technologies that are included in the set of marketing tools that contribute to the promotion of tourist services, the most effective are search marketing, classified advertising, display advertising, sponsored links, email marketing, hidden (viral) marketing; user content; blogging and SMM marketing. To increase efficiency in the target market, tourism enterprises and companies must actively use modern instrumental marketing solutions and strategies to convey to consumers the value of the products and services they offer with the help of modern digital channels and SMM marketing tools. The main reasons why it is necessary to promote tourist services in the Internet environment and social networks are highlighted. The essence of the method of user participation in social network communities is revealed. The classification of communities in social networks has been carried out. Social media marketing is characterized by quick launch, broad reach, ease of use, and the possibility of instant interaction with customers. The use of social networks as a means of promoting a tourist product on the market is cost-effective. It provides an opportunity to reach a broad audience, promptly inform actual and potential customers about new offers, and create demand for tourist services.\nKeywords: social networks, tourism, tourist enterprises, services, target audience.",

A valuable star vehicle, John Wick embedded Reeves\u2019 star persona within its filmic fabric, reinvigorating his star status beyond the digital memes that characterised him as the twenty-first century unfolded. John Wick was swiftly franchised, becoming an important media property in its own right, in dialogue with but also separate from Reeves\u2019 own stardom as it expanded into a transmedia multiverse. The franchise therefore reflects wider intersections and negotiations between celebrity, star power, business strategy, and licensed properties in contemporary media industries. This article traces the production and reception around the three released John Wick films, along with their marketing and paratextual materials and multiplatform adaptations, which increasingly deviate from using Reeves as a central star figure. It investigates the value of stardom within Hollywood franchise texts, focusing on the transformative effect of John Wick on Reeves\u2019 image and brand, the different ways in which stars stand as authenticating figures in franchise cultures, and how Reeves\u2019 own star status is simultaneously challenged and affirmed by the franchise that has come to define his later screen career.",

Du m\u00eame coup, on peut douter de la capacit\u00e9 r\u00e9elle des industries culturelles \u00e0 anticiper sur le succ\u00e8s, \u00e0 le construire : si les \u00e9tudes marketing peuvent \u00e9ventuellement renseigner sur les attentes et les go\u00fbts des publics , la segmentation croissante de ces publics et le turn over acc\u00e9l\u00e9r\u00e9 des codes et valeurs qui leur sont propres oblige \u00e0 l\u2019innovation.

Even during the pandemic, performers did not abandon their vocation and employed various online platforms to share their art. Although the use of social media for advertising and, occasionally, livestreaming traditional performances was not entirely unprecedented, the circumstances of 2020 have clearly contributed to the significant acceleration of these trends. Issues of global mediatization and virtual participation have become crucial elements within the shadow puppet theatre of the so-called jaman now (\u201cthe time of now\u201d). Some of the most famous puppeteers of Central Java, Ki Cahyo Kuntadi and Ki Seno Nugroho, invented new formats, such as wayang elektrik and wayang climen, and adopted new marketing strategies to meet a new audience demand in a time of social distance. These new forms contributed to confirm and speed-up transformation processes already embryonal to the wayang art and drastically changed the function and fruition of one of the most important Javanese performing arts. Uniting practice-led research and digital ethnography, this article intends to offer an example of how oral traditions are affected by the social and technological reverberations of the pandemic era.",

            "abstract": "The study aims to propose a typology of servicewomen\u2019s images promoted by the Ukrainian media during the Russo-Ukrainian war. Qualitative content analysis was used as a research method. The study was based on 50 articles about women in the Armed Forces of Ukraine published between November 2020 and May 2023. The timeframe was chosen given the event that marked the strengthening of the Ukrainian government\u2019s course to the further development and promotion of gender equality in the Armed Forces of Ukraine, namely the ratification of the National Action Plan for Resolution 1325 \u2013 \u201cWomen, Peace and Security\u201d for the period up to 2025. The articles were selected based on several keywords: women, the Armed Forces of Ukraine, women in the military, and gender equality. The Russo-Ukrainian war has given rise to the promotion of various images of female soldiers in the media. The media offers its audience two types of servicewomen images: 1) a conservative image based on the stereotypical perceptions of women; 2) a counter-stereotypical image that rejects clich\u00e9s and destroys gender stereotypes. The conservative typification of images of servicewomen, as a demonstration of society\u2019s concern about women performing combat missions that contradict traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity, not only reinforces the idea of traditional stereotypical roles of women but also challenges the prospects of participation of women in combat. The multifaceted gender stereotypical images \u2013 \u201cBeauty in uniform\u201d, \u201cModel for a glossy magazine\u201d, \u201cFirst of all a Woman\u201d, \u201cBeloved Woman\u201d, and \u201cMother\u201d \u2013 are permeated by benevolent sexism against women, which has three components: paternalism, gender differentiation, and heterosexual intimacy. The image \u201cPerson with special domestic needs\u201d focuses on physiological processes related to the female reproductive system. This content of the image conveys the assumption that women can face an uncomfortable situation when it is challenging to perform the necessary hygienic measures, and this can hinder them from being in the war zone. The counter-stereotypical typification manifested in the \u201cProfessional Soldier\u201d and \u201cRebel\u201d images contribute to overcoming stereotypical perceptions and shaping a society where women have equal rights and opportunities to realize these rights. Creating the \u201cProfessional Soldier\u201d image, the media assume that the main prerequisite for a professional warrior is not gender but professional competencies. The \u201cRebel\u201d image of a servicewoman represents a new generation of women who openly declare their right to be whatever they want and join the military to eliminate the \u201cweaker sex\u201d stereotype. The emphasis on masculinity in the \u201cRebel\u201d image indicates that, despite the increase in women, the media still perceives the army as a masculine organization. Both conservative-stereotypical and counter-stereotypical images, such as \u201cSexual Object\u201d and \u201cLesbian\u201d, can be created for purely commercial interests or as a marketing ploy to attract the audience.",
