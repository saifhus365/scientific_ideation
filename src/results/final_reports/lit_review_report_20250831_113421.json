We examine how multiple LLM-based agents can collaborate to solve complex problems beyond the capabilities of single agents through specialized knowledge integration and optimized communication protocols. Our novel architecture enables efficient collaboration between heterogeneous LLM agents, each with domain-specific capabilities and knowledge bases. Experimental results demonstrate that our multi-agent LLM system achieves 42% higher accuracy on complex knowledge tasks, 37% reduction in hallucinations, and 29% faster convergence on collaborative problem-solving compared to baseline approaches. By implementing optimized knowledge retrieval mechanisms and structured communication patterns, our system reduces token usage by 45% while maintaining semantic fidelity across agent interactions. These findings establish key design principles for building more effective and reliable collaborative LLM-based multi-agent systems for enterprise applications",

Despite recent advancements, LLMs still face significant challenges in reasoning with structured data, handling dynamic knowledge evolution, and mitigating hallucinations, particularly in mission-critical domains. Our proposed RAG-KG-IL framework addresses these limitations by employing a multi-agent architecture that enables continuous knowledge updates, integrates structured knowledge, and incorporates autonomous agents for enhanced explainability and reasoning. The framework utilizes RAG to ensure the generated responses are grounded in verifiable information, while KGs provide structured domain knowledge for improved consistency and depth of understanding. The Incremental Learning approach allows for dynamic updates to the knowledge base without full retraining, significantly reducing computational overhead and improving the model's adaptability. We evaluate the framework using real-world case studies involving health-related queries, comparing it to state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and a RAG-only baseline. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination rates and improves answer completeness and reasoning accuracy. The results underscore the potential of combining RAG, KGs, and multi-agent systems to create intelligent, adaptable systems capable of real-time knowledge integration and reasoning in complex domains.",

The network is divided into several zones, and a decentralized framework is proposed for coordinated control of reactive power output in each zone to regulate voltage profiles and minimize network energy loss. The VVC problem is formulated as a multi-agent decentralized partially observable constrained Markov decision process. Each zone has a central control agent that embeds graph convolution networks (GCNs) in the policy network to improve the decision-making capability. The GCN extracts graph-structured features from the ADN topology, reflecting the relationship between VVC and grid topology, and can filter noise and impute missing data. The training process includes primal-dual policy optimization to rigorously satisfy voltage safety constraints. Simulations on a 141-bus distribution system demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively minimize network energy loss and reduce voltage deviations, even in the presence of noisy or incomplete input measurements.",

            "abstract": "As public institutions increasingly adopt AI-driven virtual assistants to support transparency and citizen engagement, the need for explainable, accurate, and context-aware language systems becomes vital. While traditional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks effectively integrate external knowledge into Large Language Models (LLMs), their reliance on flat, unstructured document retrieval limits multi-hop reasoning and interpretability, especially with complex, structured e-government datasets. This study introduces a modular, extensible, multi-agent graph retrieval-augmented generation (GraphRAG) framework designed to enhance policy-focused question answering. This research aims to provide an overview of hybrid multi-agent GraphRAG architecture designed for operational deployment in e-government settings to support explainable AI systems. The study focuses on how the hybrid integration of standard RAG, embedding-based retrieval, real-time web search, and LLM-generated structured Graphs can optimize knowledge discovery from public e-government data, thereby reinforcing factual grounding, reducing hallucinations, and enhancing the quality of complex responses. To validate the proposed approach, we implement and evaluate the framework using the European Commission\u2019s Press Corner as a data source, constructing graph-based knowledge representations and embeddings, and incorporating web search. This work establishes a reproducible blueprint for deploying AI systems in e-government that require structured reasoning in comprehensive and factually accurate question answering.",

To augment this process, we introduce an AI co-scientist, a multi-agent system built on Gemini 2.0. The AI co-scientist is intended to help uncover new, original knowledge and to formulate demonstrably novel research hypotheses and proposals, building upon prior evidence and aligned to scientist-provided research objectives and guidance. The system's design incorporates a generate, debate, and evolve approach to hypothesis generation, inspired by the scientific method and accelerated by scaling test-time compute. Key contributions include: (1) a multi-agent architecture with an asynchronous task execution framework for flexible compute scaling; (2) a tournament evolution process for self-improving hypotheses generation. Automated evaluations show continued benefits of test-time compute, improving hypothesis quality. While general purpose, we focus development and validation in three biomedical areas: drug repurposing, novel target discovery, and explaining mechanisms of bacterial evolution and anti-microbial resistance. For drug repurposing, the system proposes candidates with promising validation findings, including candidates for acute myeloid leukemia that show tumor inhibition in vitro at clinically applicable concentrations. For novel target discovery, the AI co-scientist proposed new epigenetic targets for liver fibrosis, validated by anti-fibrotic activity and liver cell regeneration in human hepatic organoids. Finally, the AI co-scientist recapitulated unpublished experimental results via a parallel in silico discovery of a novel gene transfer mechanism in bacterial evolution. These results, detailed in separate, co-timed reports, demonstrate the potential to augment biomedical and scientific discovery and usher an era of AI empowered scientists.",

However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research, inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason + Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant, capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools, automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates. Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation, overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8% accuracy on Reas-100.",

This approach not only mitigates limitations inherent in individual studies but also facilitates novel discoveries through integrated data analysis. Traditional meta-analysis involves a complex multi-stage pipeline including literature retrieval, paper screening, and data extraction, which demands substantial human effort and time. However, while LLM-based methods can accelerate certain stages, they still face significant challenges, such as hallucinations in paper screening and data extraction. In this paper, we propose a multi-agent system, Manalyzer, which achieves end-to-end automated meta-analysis through tool calls. The hybrid review, hierarchical extraction, self-proving, and feedback checking strategies implemented in Manalyzer significantly alleviate these two hallucinations. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of meta-analysis, we construct a new benchmark comprising 729 papers across 3 domains, encompassing text, image, and table modalities, with over 10,000 data points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Manalyzer achieves significant performance improvements over the LLM baseline in multi meta-analysis tasks.

Efficient access to compound-related information is crucial for promoting the modernization and scientific understanding of TCM. However, existing approaches primarily rely on fragmented databases and literature-based retrieval methods, which suffer from low intelligence, poor data integration, and limited retrieval efficiency.This study presents a novel AI agent-based retrieval system tailored for compound information in TCM. The core innovation of the system lies in its hybrid retrieval-augmented generation framework, which seamlessly combines structured database queries with semantic vector retrieval. Furthermore, it integrates knowledge from three complementary sources\u2014locally built knowledge bases, domain-specific APIs, and open web search\u2014allowing for comprehensive coverage and adaptive handling of diverse natural language queries. Experiments conducted on a benchmark dataset of 150 compound-related queries demonstrate that the system achieves a peak accuracy of 96.67% across multiple mainstream LLMs. Ablation studies further reveal that removing either the hybrid RAG or multi-source knowledge module leads to a notable accuracy decline, while the full system outperforms typical RAG baselines by over 25%. These results confirm the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed architecture in TCM compound retrieval, and highlight the advantage of combining structured matching with dynamic knowledge access in specialized biomedical applications.",

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) retrieves documents to assist large language models (LLMs) in question answering; while Graph RAG (GRAG) uses structured knowledge bases as its knowledge source. However, many questions require both textual and relational information from SKB - referred to as\"hybrid\"questions - which complicates the retrieval process and underscores the need for a hybrid retrieval method that leverages both information. In this paper, through our empirical analysis, we identify key insights that show why existing methods may struggle with hybrid question answering (HQA) over SKB. Based on these insights, we propose HybGRAG for HQA consisting of a retriever bank and a critic module, with the following advantages: (1) Agentic, it automatically refines the output by incorporating feedback from the critic module, (2) Adaptive, it solves hybrid questions requiring both textual and relational information with the retriever bank, (3) Interpretable, it justifies decision making with intuitive refinement path, and (4) Effective, it surpasses all baselines on HQA benchmarks. In experiments on the STaRK benchmark, HybGRAG achieves significant performance gains, with an average relative improvement in Hit@1 of 51%.",

Our proposal aims to increase the road safety and the quality of the entire road network, especially in case of congestions, accidents and jams, considering traffic information in real-time as well as drivers travel time to attain their destinations.

In order to make such systems highly efficient and reliable, cooperative decision-making methods have been utilized as a critical technology for successful future applications. However, current multi-agent decision-making algorithms pose many challenges, including difficulties understanding human decision processes, poor time efficiency, and reduced interpretability. Thus, a real-time online collaborative decision-making model simulating human cognition is presented in this paper to solve those problems under unknown, complex, and dynamic environments. The provided model based on the Soar cognitive architecture aims to establish domain knowledge and simulate the process of human cooperation and adversarial cognition, fostering an understanding of the environment and tasks to generate real-time adversarial decisions for multi-unmanned systems. This paper devised intricate forest environments to evaluate the collaborative capabilities of agents and their proficiency in implementing various tactical strategies while assessing the effectiveness, reliability, and real-time action of the proposed model. The results reveal significant advantages for the agents in adversarial experiments, demonstrating strong capabilities in understanding the environment and collaborating effectively. Additionally, decision-making occurs in milliseconds, with time consumption decreasing as experience accumulates, mirroring the growth pattern of human decision-making.",

Firstly, a multi-agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm with parameter sharing is proposed to achieve confrontation decision-making of multi-agent. In the process of training, the information of other agents is introduced to the critic network to improve the strategy of confrontation. The parameter sharing mechanism can reduce the loss of experience storage. In the DDPG algorithm, we use four neural networks to generate real-time action and Q-value function respectively and use a momentum mechanism to optimize the training process to accelerate the convergence rate for the neural network. Secondly, this paper introduces an auxiliary controller using a policy-based reinforcement learning (RL) method to achieve the assistant decision-making for the game agent. In addition, an effective reward function is used to help agents balance losses of enemies and our side. Furthermore, this paper also uses the knowledge transfer method to extend the learning model to more complex scenes and improve the generalization of the proposed confrontation model. Two confrontation decision-making experiments are designed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In a small-scale task scenario, the trained agent can successfully learn to fight with the competitors and achieve a good winning rate. For large-scale confrontation scenarios, the knowledge transfer method can gradually improve the decision-making level of the learning agent.",

By integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the system processes vast amounts of market data to identify Elliott wave patterns and generate actionable insights. The system employs a coordinated team of specialized agents, each responsible for specific aspects of analysis, from pattern recognition to investment strategy formulation. We tested ElliottAgents on both stock and cryptocurrency markets, evaluating its effectiveness in pattern identification and trend prediction across different time scales. Our experimental results demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy when combining classical technical analysis with AI-driven approaches, particularly when enhanced by DRL-based backtesting process.

The system aims to enhance the accuracy of gas over-limit alarms and improve the efficiency of generating judgment reports. The system integrates the reasoning capabilities of LLMs and optimizes task allocation and execution efficiency of agents through the study of the hybrid multi-agent orchestration algorithm. Furthermore, the system establishes a comprehensive gas risk assessment knowledge base, encompassing historical alarm data, real-time monitoring data, alarm judgment criteria, treatment methods, and relevant policies and regulations. Additionally, the system incorporates several technologies, including retrieval-augmented generation based on human feedback mechanisms, tool management, prompt engineering, and asynchronous processing, which further enhance the application performance of the LLM in the gas status judgment system. Experimental results indicate that the system effectively improves the efficiency of gas alarm processing and the quality of judgment reports in coal mines, providing solid technical support for accident prevention and management in mining operations.",

The study also explores some details of Lang Graph and Auto Gen in construction of multi-agent systems to triage and remediate the network events. A case study on automating Root Cause Analysis (RCA) in spine-leaf topologies illustrates the practical application of these technologies. The results indicate that the detection of anomaly is quite efficient in speed, accuracy, and scalability and serve as a rather efficient way of simplifying network operations. The paper highlights, as the recognition of the role of AI in NetOps increases, the potential of converting network management with enhancements to automation and decision-making processes that LLMs and multi-agent systems provide.

The paper highlights concerns typically addressed in the development of distributed systems, such as adaptation, concurrency and fault-tolerance. It analyses how a hybrid agent/component integration approach can improve the separation of these concerns by leveraging modularity constructs already available in agent and component systems.

            "abstract": "A key research area in autonomous driving is how to model the driver\u2019s decision-making behavior, due to the fact it is significant for a self-driving vehicles considering their traffic safety and efficiency. However, the uncertain characteristics of vehicle and pedestrian trajectories affect urban roads, which poses severe challenges to the cognitive understanding and decision-making of autonomous vehicle systems in terms of accuracy and robustness. To overcome the abovementioned problems, this paper proposes a Bayesian driver agent (BDA) model which is a vision-based autonomous vehicle system with learning and inference methods inspired by human driver\u2019s cognitive psychology. Different from the end-to-end learning method and traditional rule-based methods, our approach breaks the driving system up into a scene recognition module and a decision inference module. The perception module, which is based on a multi-task learning neural network (CNN), takes a driver\u2019s-view image as its input and predicts the traffic scene\u2019s feature values. The decision module based on dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) then makes an inferred decision using the traffic scene\u2019s feature values. To explore the validity of the Bayesian driver agent model, we performed experiments on a driving simulation platform. The BDA model can extract the scene feature values effectively and predict the probability distribution of the human driver\u2019s decision-making process accurately based on inference. We take the lane changing scenario as an example to verify the model, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) correlation between the BDA model and human driver\u2019s decision process reached 0.984. This work suggests a research in scene perception and autonomous decision-making that may apply to autonomous vehicle system.",

In this talk, I will explore the frontiers of AI-driven knowledge retrieval and reasoning, drawing from recent research on knowledge graphs, semi-structured retrieval, adaptive tool use, and multi-turn AI collaboration. I will also discuss how agentic frameworks enable rigorous, automated hypothesis validation through sequential falsifications. Together, these advancements push beyond traditional search and QA systems, unlocking new capabilities for knowledge discovery, scientific research, and human-AI collaboration.

The goal is to take advantage of recent developments in AI models to define a hybrid architecture that combines deep reinforcement learning (DRL), large language models (LLMs), and rule-based models. The motivation comes from the fact that modern network segments within colored clouds are using software-defined controllers with the means to host ACD agents and other cybersecurity tools implementing hybrid AI models. For example, our ACD agent uses a DRL model and the chatbot uses an LLM to create an interface with human cybersecurity experts. The ACD agent was evaluated against two red agent strategies in a gym environment using a set of actions to defend services in the network (monitor, analyse, decoy, remove, and restore). Our chatbot was developed using retrieval augmented generation and a prompting agent to augment a pre-trained LLM with data from cybersecurity knowledge graphs. We performed a comparative analysis between a baseline implementation and our chatbot using generation/retrieval metrics. The results suggest that both ACD agent and chatbot can potentially enhance the defence of critical networks connected to untrusted infrastructure.",

Traditional model-based approaches, including those leveraging in-context demonstrations and those with specialized medical fine-tuning, have demonstrated strong performance in medical language processing but struggle with real-time adaptability, multi-step reasoning, and handling complex medical tasks. Agent-based AI systems address these limitations by incorporating reasoning traces, tool selection based on context, knowledge retrieval, and both short- and long-term memory. These additional features enable the medical AI agent to handle complex medical scenarios where decision-making should be built on real-time interaction with the environment. Therefore, unlike conventional model-based approaches that treat medical queries as isolated questions, medical AI agents approach them as complex tasks and behave more like human doctors. In this paper, we study the choice of the backbone LLM for medical AI agents, which is the foundation for the agent's overall reasoning and action generation. In particular, we consider the emergent o1 model and examine its impact on agents' reasoning, tool-use adaptability, and real-time information retrieval across diverse clinical scenarios, including high-stakes settings such as intensive care units (ICUs). Our findings demonstrate o1's ability to enhance diagnostic accuracy and consistency, paving the way for smarter, more responsive AI tools that support better patient outcomes and decision-making efficacy in clinical practice.",

In this context, the proliferation of Internet of Things standards and data ecosystems is advancing the feasibility of data-driven condition monitoring and remanufacturing. This is particularly desirable for the end-of-life recovery of high-value equipment towards sustainable closed-loop production systems. Low-Power Wide-Area Networks, despite being relatively recent, are starting to be conceived as key-enabling technologies built upon the principles of long-range communication and negligible energy consumption. While LoRaWAN is considered the open standard with the highest level of acceptance from both industry and academia, it is its random access protocol (Aloha) that limits its capacity in large-scale deployments to some extent. Although time-slotted scheduling has proved to alleviate certain scalability limitations, the constrained nature of end nodes and their application-oriented requirements significantly increase the complexity of time-slotted network management tasks. To shed light on this matter, a multi-agent network management system for the on-demand allocation of resources in end-of-life monitoring applications for remanufacturing is introduced in this work. It leverages LoRa\u2019s spreading factor orthogonality and network-wide knowledge to increase the number of nodes served in time-slotted monitoring setups. The proposed system is validated and evaluated for end-of-life monitoring where two representative end-node distributions were emulated, with the achieved network capacity improvements ranging from 75.27% to 249.46% with respect to LoRaWAN\u2019s legacy operation. As a result, the suitability of different agent-based strategies has been evaluated and a number of lessons have been drawnaccording to different application and hardware constraints. While the presented findings can be used to further improve the explainability of the proposed models (in line with the concept of eXplainable AI), the overall framework represents a step forward in lightweight end-of-life condition monitoring for remanufacturing.",

Recent approaches for the creation of Intrusion Response Systems (IRSs) use Reinforcement Learning (RL) as a primary technique for the optimal or near-optimal selection of the proper countermeasure to take in order to stop or mitigate an ongoing attack. However, most of them do not consider the fact that systems can change over time or, in other words, that systems exhibit a non-stationary behavior. Furthermore, stateful approaches, such as those based on RL, suffer the curse of dimensionality, due to a state space growing exponentially with the size of the protected system. In this paper, we introduce and develop an IRS software prototype, named irs-partition. It leverages the partitioning of the protected system and Deep Q-Networks to address the curse of dimensionality by supporting a multi-agent formulation. Furthermore, it exploits transfer learning to follow the evolution of non-stationary systems.",

Even though a lot of work has been done to devise a real-time agent very few of them focus on dynamic responses. The challenges for automatic medical diagnosis not only include issues for topic transition coherency and question understanding but also issues regarding the context of medical knowledge and symptoms of disease relations. In this paper, we propose a conversational agent that not only generates answers to specific medical questions but also makes more natural and human-like conversations and can adapt to the context and evolve over time. We propose an End-to-End knowledge-routed Relational Dialogue System that would incorporate a rich medical knowledge graph into the topic transition in dialogue management, and make it accommodative with NLU (Natural Language Understanding) and NLG (Natural Language Generation). A knowledge-routed graph for topic decision-making is used, which helps to identify relationships between symptoms and symptom-disease pairs. However, there are constraints on the extent of questions that knowledge graphs can address independently. To overcome these, we have used a fine-tuned GPT-3 model. While knowledge graphs organize data as interconnected entities, GPT-3 generates human-like text using learned patterns from large datasets. This approach enhances responses to intricate queries.",

            "abstract": "Future wireless networks will need to support diverse applications (such as extended reality), scenarios (such as fully automated industries), and technological advances (such as terahertz communications). Current wireless networks are designed to perform adequately across multiple scenarios so they lack the adaptability needed for specific use cases. Therefore, meeting the stringent requirements of next-generation applications incorporating technology advances and operating in novel scenarios will necessitate wireless specialized networks which we refer to as SpecNets. These networks, equipped with cognitive capabilities, dynamically adapt to the unique demands of each application, e.g., by automatically selecting and configuring network mechanisms. An enabler of SpecNets are the recent advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), which allow to continuously learn and react to changing requirements and scenarios. By integrating AI/ML functionalities, SpecNets will fully leverage the concept of AI/ML-defined radios (MLDRs) that are able to autonomously establish their own communication protocols by acquiring contextual information and dynamically adapting to it. In this paper, we introduce SpecNets and explain how MLDR interfaces enable this concept. We present three illustrative use cases for wireless local area networks (WLANs): bespoke industrial networks, traffic-aware robust THz links, and coexisting networks. Finally, we showcase SpecNets' benefits in the industrial use case by introducing a lightweight, fast-converging ML agent based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). This agent dynamically optimizes channel access to meet varying performance needs: high throughput, low delay, or fair access. Results demonstrate significant gains over IEEE 802.11, highlighting the system's autonomous adaptability across diverse scenarios.",

            "abstract": "In end-to-end autonomous driving, current sensor fusion and navigational control techniques used by imitation learning algorithms are insufficient in challenging scenarios involving multiple dynamic agents and result in poor driving capabilities. To tackle this issue, we introduce DMFuser, a transformer-based algorithm that employs knowledge distillation between multi-task student and single-task teachers and combines attention and convolutions to fuse multiple RGB-D camera representations to produce vehicular navigational commands (throttle, steering and brake). Our model incorporates two modules. The first module, perception, encodes data from RGB-D cameras for tasks like semantic segmentation, semantic depth cloud (SDC) mapping, and traffic light state recognition. To enhance feature extraction and fusion from both RGB and depth sources, we harness local and global capabilities of convolution and transformer modules. We employ an attention-CNN fusion structure to effectively learn and fuse RGB and SDC map features. Subsequently, the control module decodes these features along with supplementary data, containing environment\u2019s static and dynamic information, to predict waypoints and vehicular control actions. We evaluate the model and conduct a comparative analysis, in various scenarios, weather conditions, and traffic situations, spanning from normal to adversarial in the CARLA simulator. We achieve better or comparable results in term of driving score (DS) and other metrics with respect to our baselines. Also, our ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our contributions to improve the driving skills.

These \\textit{cognitive and immersive systems} (CAISs) fall squarely into the intersection of AI with HCI/HRI: such systems interact with and assist the human agents that enter them, in no small part because such systems are infused with AI able to understand and reason about these humans and their knowledge, beliefs, goals, communications, plans, etc. We herein explain our approach to engineering CAISs. We emphasize the capacity of a CAIS to develop and reason over a `theory of the mind' of its human partners. This capacity entails that the AI in question has a sophisticated model of the beliefs, knowledge, goals, desires, emotions, etc.\\ of these humans. To accomplish this engineering, a formal framework of very high expressivity is needed. In our case, this framework is a \\textit{cognitive event calculus}, a particular kind of quantified multi-operator modal logic, and a matching high-expressivity automated reasoner and planner. To explain, advance, and to a degree validate our approach, we show that a calculus of this type satisfies a set of formal requirements, and can enable a CAIS to understand a psychologically tricky scenario couched in what we call the \\textit{cognitive polysolid framework} (CPF). We also formally show that a room that satisfies these requirements can have a useful property we term \\emph{expectation of usefulness}. CPF, a sub-class of \\textit{cognitive microworlds}, includes machinery able to represent and plan over not merely blocks and actions (such as seen in the primitive `blocks worlds' of old), but also over agents and their mental attitudes about both other agents and inanimate objects.",

            "abstract": "\n \n Background. Recent advancements in genome characterization have transformed the study of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Accordingly, there has been a shift from traditional classification and prognostication methods, which relied mainly on morphological and clinical data, to next-generation systems that incorporate genomic features. However, genetic abnormalities account for only part of the overall risk related to survival, disease progression, and individual response to hypomethylating agents (HMA), indicating that a significant portion of these risks is still tied to clinical and non-mutational factors. Increasing evidence suggests that transcriptomics, immune dysfunctions, and high-dimensional tumor morphology data extracted by Artificial Intelligence (AI) may play a crucial role in predicting clinical outcomes in human cancers, thereby improving the implementation of personalized medicine programs.\n Aim. In this scenario, we developed MEGAERA, an innovative, deep learning-based framework for multimodal analysis of hematological malignancies. MEGAERA integrates clinical, multi-omics, and histopathological data, using specific strategies to ensure full clinical explainability and interpretability of predictions. This study was conducted by the GenoMed4All and Synthema EU consortia, with MDS included as use case, to improve personalized predictions of patient outcomes.\n Methods. The study population consisted of 605 MDS patients from Humanitas Research Hospital. For these patients, multi-modal data were available, including clinical characteristics, cytogenetics, somatic mutation screening on 31 genes, bulk RNA-seq of CD34+ bone marrow (BM) cells, and deep flow cytometry evaluation of T lymphocytes, natural killer and myeloid cells. Whole slide images (WSI) of BM biopsies stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and May-Grunwald Giemsa (MGG) were also retrieved. Comprehensive information on treatments and clinical outcomes was collected.\n MEGAERA deep-learning workflow involves two processing layers. The first one exploits a custom fine-tuned implementation of Prov-GigaPath for WSI segmentation and features extraction. The second layer uses Self-Normalizing Networks with two hidden layers for handling clinical and molecular profiles. All the processed variables are combined and fed into a fusion model that correlates them to clinical outcomes. Explainability was implemented using attention-based maps for WSI and Shapley Additive Explanations Approach for feature importance rankings. The predictive ability of the approach was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (CI).\n Results. We used Prov-GigaPath on BM WSI for extracting morphological features. Prov-GigaPath outperformed current state-of-the-art methods including ResNet50 and DinoBloom, achieving 10% improvement of CI.\n We evaluated MAGAERA's predictive performance on MDS population, analyzing the multimodal integration alongside unimodal contributions, with Overall Survival (OS) as primary endpoint. Sequential integration of data modalities into the model showed an increasing CI for OS: starting with 0.56 CI considering clinical information alone, then rising to 0.81 CI by including cytogenetic, genomic, transcriptomic and immunologic signatures, and finally reaching 0.85 CI with morphological features integration. Our fusion model significantly enhanced the performance of conventional IPSS-R (0.68) and IPSS-M (0.76) scores. Similar improvements were observed in predicting leukemic evolution risk (0.83) and the individual probability of response to HMA treatment (0.84).\n An extensive validation of the model's performance was performed using multimodal synthetic data (PMID: 37390377), reaching comparable CI. To facilitate the clinical implementation of this framework, we are exploring innovative AI-based dimensionality reduction and inference approaches, to enable model's knowledge transfer to patients lacking information collected outside diagnostic routine tests.\n Conclusion. The MEGAERA multimodal fusion model demonstrated improved clinical outcome prediction in MDS patients. Our approach leverages full interpretability to elucidate features contribution to risk prediction. This framework is expected to significantly enhance clinical decision-making in MDS by supporting the implementation of personalized medicine programs.\n",
